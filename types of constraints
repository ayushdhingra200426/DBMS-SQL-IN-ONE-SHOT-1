create table contacts(
name varchar(50),
mobile_no varchar(50) unique check(length(mobile_no) >= 10)
);

this is how we use the constraints like unique and check or not null or default or primary key or foreign key 

sometimes during the check constraint when the check constraint is violated the user will not be able to know that why the check constraint has been violated 
to see why it has been violated we use named constraint to see

create table contacts(
name varchar(50),
mob varchar(15) UNIQUE,
CONSTRAINT mob_no_less_than_10 CHECK(LENGTH(mob)>=10)
);



by this if we insert the values in them and if the check constraint is violated then
it will show that mob_no_less_than_10
