If you wanted max salary for each name

SELECT fname, MAX(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY fname;

select fname,max(salary) from employees; // this will display wrong output of the name with the highest salary
so if you want the name of the person with the highest salary you have to use the subqueries



select emp_id,fname from employees where salary=(select max(salary) from employees);

this is the correct query of you want to display the record with the aggregate functions just use sub queries
