If you wanted max salary for each name

SELECT fname, MAX(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY fname;

select fname,max(salary) from employees; // this will display wrong output of the name with the highest salary
so if you want the name of the person with the highest salary you have to use the subqueries
