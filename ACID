A – Atomicity
The whole transaction is done completely or not done at all.
(All or nothing)

C – Consistency
After the transaction, the database must remain in a valid state.
(No rule is broken)

I – Isolation
Multiple transactions do not affect each other.
(Each transaction works as if it is alone)

D – Durability
Once the transaction is committed, the changes will remain even if the system crashes.
(Data is permanent)

Remember like this for fast recall:
All-or-nothing, Correct state, Independent transactions, Data stays.
