A – Atomicity
The whole transaction is done completely or not done at all.
(All or nothing)

C – Consistency
After the transaction, the database must remain in a valid state.
(No rule is broken)

I – Isolation
Multiple transactions do not affect each other.
(Each transaction works as if it is alone)

D – Durability
Once the transaction is committed, the changes will remain even if the system crashes.
(Data is permanent)

Remember like this for fast recall:
All-or-nothing, Correct state, Independent transactions, Data stays.

KEY POINTS TO REMEMBER


FOREIGN KEY CAN ACCEPT NULL VALUES

Serializable Schedule

A schedule is Serializable if its final result is same as if the transactions were executed one by one (serially).
It maintains correctness of the database.

In short:

Serializable = Same final result as serial execution = Correct & safe

Non-Serializable Schedule

A schedule is Non-Serializable if its final result is NOT same as any serial execution of transactions.
It may produce wrong or inconsistent data.

In short:

Non-Serializable = Final result differs from serial execution = Can be incorrect
