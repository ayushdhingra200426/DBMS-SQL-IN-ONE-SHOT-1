A – Atomicity
The whole transaction is done completely or not done at all.
(All or nothing)

C – Consistency
After the transaction, the database must remain in a valid state.
(No rule is broken)

I – Isolation
Multiple transactions do not affect each other.
(Each transaction works as if it is alone)

D – Durability
Once the transaction is committed, the changes will remain even if the system crashes.
(Data is permanent)

Remember like this for fast recall:
All-or-nothing, Correct state, Independent transactions, Data stays.

KEY POINTS TO REMEMBER


FOREIGN KEY CAN ACCEPT NULL VALUES

Serializable Schedule

A schedule is Serializable if its final result is same as if the transactions were executed one by one (serially).
It maintains correctness of the database.

In short:

Serializable = Same final result as serial execution = Correct & safe

Non-Serializable Schedule

A schedule is Non-Serializable if its final result is NOT same as any serial execution of transactions.
It may produce wrong or inconsistent data.

In short:

Non-Serializable = Final result differs from serial execution = Can be incorrect

ARIES (Write-Ahead Logging)

ARIES stands for:

Algorithms for
Recovery and
Isolation
Exploiting
Semantics

It is a database recovery technique used when the system crashes.

Key Idea of ARIES

ARIES uses Write-Ahead Logging (WAL):

Log is written first, then data is written to database.

So if a crash happens, data can be recovered from the log.

Why is ARIES used?

It helps to:

Undo incomplete transactions

Redo completed transactions

Recover database after crash

One-line MCQ Answer

ARIES is a recovery technique based on Write-Ahead Logging where log records are written before actual data is updated.


Dirty Read means reading data from a transaction that has not been committed yet.

If the first transaction rolls back later, the second transaction will have read wrong (dirty) data.

Simple Example

T1 updates a balance from 1000 → 500 (but does NOT commit yet)

T2 reads the balance as 500

Then T1 rolls back to 1000

Now T2 has used incorrect data (because it read something that never officially happened).
This incorrect read is called Dirty Read.

One-Line MCQ answer

Dirty Read occurs when a transaction reads uncommitted changes made by another transaction.
