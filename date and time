HOUR()

for example we want date as per our norms like 

21st tuesday at 21:20:28

then use select DATE_FORMAT();

SELECT DATE_FORMAT(NOW(), '%D %a at %T');

if we want of the format 
that the result is 04/16/23

capital alphabet with the suffix indicates the day with 'st'

like above it is written that day is 21st

there are various other like %d/%m/%y
for day/month/year

for example table is given with jd,jt,jdt

and we have to apply this date format to the jdt 

then we will use it by 

select jdt,DATE_FORMAT(jdt,'%D %a at %k') from table_name;
in dateformat jdt is written to tell what to which column we have to apply the format

select DATEDIFF('2025-06-03','2025-06-08'); RESULT IS -5
select DATEDIFF('2025-06-08','2025-06-03'); RESULT IS 5 

ANOTHER METHODS ARE 

DATE_ADD(date,INTERVAL expr unit)
DATE_SUB(date,INTERVAL expr unit)

syntax is ->

select DATE_ADD('2023-05-01',INTERVAL 1 DAY)
select DATE_ADD('2023-05-01',INTERVAL 1 YEAR)
select DATE_ADD('2023-05-01',INTERVAL 1 MONTH)

THIS IS USED TO SHOW THE USED WHAT WILL BE THE DATE AFTER THE INTERVAL 

FOR EXAMPLE

SELECT DATE_ADD(NOW(),INTERVAL 1 YEAR);
NOW OTHER METHOD WHICH HAS THE SUB WORKING IS 

SELECT DATE_SUB('2023-04-21',INTERVAL 1 MONTH);
// TIMED DIFF

SELECT TIMEDIFF('23:00:00','20:00:50');
output -> 02:59:10
